## Overview
This application is a chance for students to build a Static comp of our own to continue to develop our CSS and HTML skills. This Solo Challenge gave us a chance to show where we are with the foundational concepts of the Mod 1 and 2 curriculum. In this challenge, we utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a static comp of a website. 


## Setup
